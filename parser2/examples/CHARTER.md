(e) The DAO Members shall utilize the Designated Smart Contracts as the exclusive methods of holding, allocating among the DAO Members, and spending or otherwise distributing any Tokens that are DAO Property, of minting and issuing Nation3 Passports and holding and recording votes of the DAO Members. The DAO may also utilize the Designated Smart Contracts to administer and facilitate certain other arrangements and transactions involving the DAO, the DAO Members and/or third Members.

If the DAO Members agree upon such matters during the Negotiation Period, the DAO Members shall promptly enter into an Exception Handling Addendum reflecting the same.
